This tweak changes how the "colonists need names" alert locates pawns.
By default, Twitch Toolkit includes all pawns that appear in the colonist bar as potential
candidates, including 1.1's borrowed pawns and RimWorld of Magic's undead.
As you may have guessed, Utils changes those two specifically. This means that quest pawns
will not longer fire off the alert, nor will a necromancer's undead.
