## Command Prefix

While the command handler is enabled, users are permitted to change the command prefix
for all commands available in Toolkit, Utils, and any future add-ons created. The prefix
can be anything, including a sentence, but it's generally advised to keep it short and
simple.

You can configure the prefix via the settings menu for ToolkitUtils. You can find the
setting under the `General` category.
