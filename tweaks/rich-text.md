## Unrichify

This tweak changes how some events processes input, like trait names, to remove
the need to specify html tags, like `<color>`. Users are allowed to disable this
tweak via the settings menu for ToolkitUtils. You can find the setting under the
`General` category.

### Affected Events

Currently this tweak only affects a limited number of events:

- Adding traits
- Removing traits
