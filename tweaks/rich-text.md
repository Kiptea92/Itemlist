This tweak changes how some events process input, like trait names, to remove
the need to specify html tags, like `<color>`. If you don't want to use this
tweak, you can disable it in ToolkitUtils' settings menu.

While you can disable this tweak, it's strongly recommended to keep it enabled
to promote a positive user experience.

### Affected Events

Currently this tweak only affects a limited number of events:

- Adding traits
- Removing traits

If an event does not strip rich text, you're free to submit a bug report on
the mod's [issue tracker]({{ site.github.issues_url }}/new).
