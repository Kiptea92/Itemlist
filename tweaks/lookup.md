With the inclusion of [race support]({{- "/tweaks/races" | relative_url -}}),
the `!lookup` command was extended to include races. Outside race support,
this command functions simliarly to Toolkit's, except that it includes support
for quoted text (`"my little query"`).

In addition to race support, the command also supports stat category lookups
via the `stats` parameter.
