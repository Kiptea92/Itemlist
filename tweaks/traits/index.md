## Trait Tweaks

This tweak changes how Toolkit handles user input when buying or removing
a trait. One of the changes is mentioned in the [rich text tweak]({{- "/tweaks/rich-text" | relative_url -}}).
Another change allows viewers to use quoted text when buying or removing
traits, e.g. `!buy trait "Psychically Hypersensitive"` would add psychically
hypersensitive to the viewer's pawn. The other change tweaks how Toolkit's
shop handles traits. You can read more about this change in the
[trait shop config]({{- "/tweaks/traits/config" | relative_url -}}).
