## Founder Support

ToolkitUtils extends Toolkit's internals to add support for Twitch's `founder` badge.
This tweak also does a little extra parsing to ensure viewers get recognized for
what they are, whether that be a moderator, global moderator, and/or Twitch staff.

It's important to note that this tweak *only* allows Toolkit to recognize founders as
subscribers. It does **not** allow you provide special settings for founders.
